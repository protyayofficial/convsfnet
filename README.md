# ConvSFNet: Enhanced Disaster Image Classification

This project enhances disaster image classification by building upon the [Medic repository](https://github.com/firojalam/medic). We introduce a novel architecture combining ConvNeXt with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to improve classification accuracy and address overfitting issues.

## Features

- **Enhanced Model Architecture**: Integration of ConvNeXt with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN).
- **Improved Preprocessing**: Advanced preprocessing techniques to enhance model performance.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Detailed evaluation metrics and results for various models.
